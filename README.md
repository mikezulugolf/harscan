# harscan
## Purpose
Chrome and Firefox can record sessions and export then in a "har" format, which contains a large JSON object.  "harscan.pl" turns this JSON into something readable - 1 line per request found
## Usage
harscan(1).pl filename
## Notes
"harscan.pl" and "harscan1.pl" should return the same, they just differ in some implementation details.
